This is a task management application for PCs that I made.

Some of the key functionalities of this application are:
- Setting up reminders to send alerts 
- Allowing the task to be repeated DAILY, WEEKLY or MONTHLY.
- Editing the details of a task.

I used [OpenJDK 17](https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk/17/) and [JavaFX 11](https://openjfx.io/) to build this application.
